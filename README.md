# Video-Player-Screengrab
Practical implementation of using HTML5 canvas to extract frames or screen grabs from a video. 

To test this project, paste <b>videotest.html</b> into https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic

Note: Using canvas to grab screenshots will only work if the video is embedded in the same domain. For this example, I have referenced a video already available with w3schools.com.
